## The Serial Position Effect

**系列位置效应**（英语：serial-position effect）是一种心理学现象，指人们倾向于对首先见到的事物和最后见到的事物有更好的印象。分为**首因效应**（primacy effect）和**近因效应**（recency effect）。

## Models of Working Memory

- Baddeley's model
- Cowan's model

## Principles of Memory

- The Cue-driven Principle
    In all situations, the act of remembering begins with a cue that initiates the retrieval process
- The Encoding-retrieval Principle
    Memory depends on the relation between the conditions at encoding and the conditions at retrieval
- The Cue Overload Principle
    Cues can become associated with more and more items at various encoding opportunities, thus reducing their effectiveness at the time of retrieval
- The Reconstruction Principle
    Memory, similar to other cognitive processes, is inherently constructive. Information present at encoding, cues at retrieval, memories of previous recollections, indeed, any possibly useful information, are all exploited to construct a response to a cue
- The Impurity Principle
    One consequence of the reconstruction principle is the realization that on any task, people recruit and use a wide variety of information and processes. Therefore, tasks are not pure and processes are not pure, and inferences based on the assumption that a task taps a particular memory system or requires only one particular process are likely to be misguide
- The Relative Distinctiveness Principle
    Items will be well remembered to the extent that they are more distinct than competing items at the time of retrieval
- The Specificity Principle
    Those tasks that require specific information about the context in which memories were formed are more vulnerable to interference or forgetfulness than those that rely on more general information
