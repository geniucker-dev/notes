### Liquid and solution
- Solubility
    - Gas solubility in Liquid: Henry's law ( $C=kP$ )
    - Vapor pressure of a solution: Raoult's law ( $P_{soln}=\chi_{solvent}P^o_{solvent}$ )
    - like dissolves like = deviation from Raoult's law
- Colligative properties
    $$\Delta T_b=iK_bm_{solute}$$
    $m_{solute}$ is ***molality***  
    $$\Delta T_m=iK_fm_{solute}$$
    $m_{solute}$ is ***molality***  
    osmotic pressure:
    $$\Pi=iMRT$$
    $M$ is ***molarity***
