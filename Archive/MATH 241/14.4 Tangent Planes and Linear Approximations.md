## Tangent Planes
**Equation of a Tangent Plane**
$$z-z_0=f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)+f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)$$

## Linear Approximations
$$L(x,y)=f(a,b)+f_x(a,b)(x-a)+f_y(a,b)(y-b)$$
is called the **linearization** of $f$ at $(a,b)$.
And the approximation
$$f(x,y)\approx f(a,b)+f_x(a,b)(x-a)+f_y(a,b)(y-b)$$
is called the **linear approximation** of $f$ at $(a,b)$.

## Differentials

### Differentiability
#### Definition
If $z=f(x,y)$, then $f$ is **differentiable** at $(a,b)$ if $\Delta z$ can be expressed in the form
$$\Delta z=f_x(a,b)\Delta x+f_y(a,b)\Delta y+\varepsilon_1\Delta x+\varepsilon_2\Delta y$$
where $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ are functions of $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ such that $\varepsilon_1\text{ and }\varepsilon_2\to0$ as $\Delta x\text{ and }\Delta y\to0$.
#### Theorem
If the partial derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$ exist near $(a,b)$ and are continuous at $(a,b)$, then $f$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$.

### Differentials
#### Definition
For a differentiable function of two variables $z=f(x,y)$, we define the **differentials** $dx$ and $dy$ to be independent variables; that is, they can be given any values. Then thee differential $dz$, also called the **total differential**, is defined by
$$dz=f_x(a,b)dx+f_y(a,b)dy=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy$$

#### Differential and Linear Approximation
If we take $dx=\Delta x=x-a$ and $dy=\Delta y=y-b$, then the differential of $z$ is
$$dz=f_x(a,b)(x-a)+f_y(a,b)(y-b)$$
So, in the notation of differentials, the linear approximation of $f$ at $(a,b)$ is
$$f(x,y)\approx f(a,b)+dz$$

## Functions of Three or More Variables
Similar to the two-variable case.
