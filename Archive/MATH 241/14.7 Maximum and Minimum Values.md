## Local Maximum and Minimum Values

### Definition
A function of two variables has a **local maximum** at $(a,b)$ if $f(x,y)\leq f(a,b)$ when $(x,y)$ is near $(a,b)$. [This means that $f(x,y)\leq f(a,b)$ for all points $(x,y)$ in some disk with center $(a,b)$.] The number $f(a,b)$ is called a **local maximum value**. If $f(x,y)\geq f(a,b)$ when $(x,y)$ is near $(a,b)$, then $f(a,b)$ has a **local minimum** at $(a,b)$ and $f(a,b)$ is a **local minimum value**.

### Theorem
If $f$ has a local maximum or minimum at $(a,b)$ and the first-order partial derivatives of $f$ exist there, then $f_x(a,b)=0$ and $f_y(a,b)=0$.
**Proof**:
Let $g(x)=f(x,b)$. If $f$ has a local maximum (or minimum) at $(a,b)$, then $g$ has a local maximum (or minimum) at $a$, so $g'(a)=0$ by Fermat's Theorem. But $g'(a)=f_x(a,b)$ and so $f_x(a,b)=0$. Similarly, $f_y(a,b)=0$.

### Critical Points
A point $(a,b)$ is called a **critical point** (or *stationary point*) of $f$ if $f_x(a,b)=0$ and $f_y(a,b)=0$ or if one or both partial derivatives do not exist.
[[#Theorem]] says that if $f$ has a local maximum or minimum at $(a,b)$, then $(a,b)$ is a critical point of $f$. However, as in single-variable calculus, not all critical points give rise to maxima or minima.

### Second Derivative Test
Suppose the second partial derivatives of $f$ are continuous on a disk with center $(a,b)$, and suupose that $f_x(a,b)=0$ and $f_y(a,b)=0$ [so that $(a,b)$ is a critical point of $f$]. Let
$$D=D(a,b)=f_{xx}(a,b)f_{yy}(a,b)-[f_{xy}(a,b)]^2$$
(a) If $D>0$ and $f_{xx}(a,b)>0$, then $f(a,b)$ is a local minimum of $f$.
(b) If $D>0$ and $f_{xx}(a,b)<0$, then $f(a,b)$ is a local maximum of $f$.
(c) If $D<0$, then $(a,b)$ is a saddle point of $f$.
**Proof**:
(a) We compute the second-order directional derivative of $f$ in the direction of $\mathbf{u}=\langle h,k\rangle$. The first-order derivative is given by
$$D_{\mathbf{u}}f=\nabla f\cdot\mathbf{u}=f_xh+f_yk$$
Applying the directional derivative formula again, we obtain
$$
\begin{aligned}
D_{\mathbf{u}}^2f & = \nabla(D_{\mathbf{u}}f)\cdot\mathbf{u}  \\
& = (f_{xx}h+f_{xy}k)h+(f_{yx}h+f_{yy}k)k  \\
& = f_{xx}h^2+2f_{xy}hk+f_{yy}k^2  \\
\end{aligned}
$$
If we complete the square in this expression, we obtain
$$D_{\mathbf{u}}^2f=f_{xx}(h+\frac{f_{xy}}{f_{xx}}k)^2+\frac{k^2}{f_{xx}}(f_{yy}f_{xx}-f_{xy}^2)$$
We are given that $f_{xx}(a,b)>0$ and $D(a,b)>0$.
