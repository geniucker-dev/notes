## Intermolecular forces
-  van der Waals force
    - Dipole-dipole attraction (取向力)
    - London Dispersion Force: instantaneous dipole
- Hydrogen bond

## The forces in a liquid
- ***surface tension*** (表面张力): The resistance of a liquid to an increase in its surface area.
- Polar liquids typically exhibit ***capillary action***, the spontaneous rising of a liquid in a narrow tube.
    two relevant types forces:
    - ***Cohesive forces*** (内聚力): the intermolecular forces among the molecules of the liquid
    - ***Adhesive forces*** (粘附力): the forces between the liquid molecules and their container
- ***Viscosity*** (黏性): A measure of a liquid’s resistance to flow. Another property of liquids strongly dependent on intermolecular forces

## Structure of Solid
### Lattice Structure of Crystalline Solids
- ***lattice***: 
- ***unit cell***: the smallest repeating unit of the lattice
### X-ray Analysis of Solid
***Bragg Equation***: $n\lambda = 2dsin\theta$

记两个词：
- in-phase: 同相的
- out of phase: 反相的
### Types of Crystal
- Atomic Solids
    - Metallic
    - Network
    - Group 8A
- Molecular Solids
- Ionic Solids
### Band Model in Metals
Also called Molecular Orbital Model. When many metal atoms interact, the gap of energy among molecular orbitals become more closely and finally form a virtual continuum of levels, called ***bands***. Like the picture bellow:
![[2.png|600]]
(we can see that the energy gap between filled MO and empty MO, thus the electrons in partially filled bonds are mobile)
### Network Solids
***Network solids***: Many atomic solids contain strong directional covalent bonds to form a solid that might best be viewed as a “giant molecule.”
- These materials are typically brittle and do not efficiently conduct heat or electricity.
- a large gap between the filled and the empty orbital levels. Electrons cannot be transferred easily to the empty conduction bands.
- Anisotropy (各向异性): graphite has very strong bonding within the layers of carbon atoms but little bonding between the layers
### Doped silicon solid: semiconductors
