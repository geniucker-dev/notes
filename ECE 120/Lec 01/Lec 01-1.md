## Computers are ***Universal*** Computation Devices
Super computer uses actually the same oprating operations as a simple cell phone so they can finish same task with abundant time.  

## More Neurons than Transistors
Neurons are more powerfull than transistors because more neurons can be housed in the same space.  

## ECE Has Undergone a Digital Convergence

## Bottom Up Approach Provides a Firm Understanding
why do we build from the ground up?
- Helps you develop of solid understand of the design an operation of each level.  
- Easier to make effective use of abstractions and to improve those abstractions.  
- Our students have been successful based on this approach (alumni feedback).  

## **Read the Wiki Every Day**

- Patt & Patel, 2nd edition  
- ~150 pages of notes (free online)  
Read those notes (see the Canvas for which parts)  
- before class  
- AND after class  
Look at learning objectives in notes summary sections.  
Use the online tools to practice.  
Be wary of the Web. No one has screened tehe content for accuracy.  

## Word load Includes Labs and Homework
Weekly lab assignments  
- Software and hardware  
- Usually due ***`Fridays at 11:59 p.m.`***
