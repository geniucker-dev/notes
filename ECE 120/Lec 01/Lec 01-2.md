## Abstraction Separates Function from Implementation
e.g.

Many implementations (实现) are possible!

## A Language Can be Implemented with Many ISAs

Below the device layer are the elections.  

The colors indecate the typical basis for each layer  
- <span style="color: e5e108;">human language / theory</span>
- <span style="color: 9dda59;">software</span>
- <span style="color: 0bb9fe;">digital hardware</span>
#### Problems/Tasks:  
- stated in natural (human) language  
- e.g.: What's the sum of numbers between 1 and 3?  
- **Problem inherent(固有的) to natural language: ambiguity.**  
- Another e.g.: Time flies like an arrow.  
#### Algorithms:  
- a step-by-stop process to solve a problem  
- requires 3 things:
    - **definiteness** (no ambiguity)  
    - **effective computability** (each step simple enough for a computer)  
    - **finiteniess** (finishes)  
#### Computer Language  
- 1000s of choices  
- e.g.: C, C++, Java, Python  
- we use C in 120 & 220  
    - easy mapping to lower levels  
    - s subset of other languages  
#### Machine/Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):
- interface between solfware and hardware  
- e.g.: x86, ARM, PowerPC  
#### Microarchitecture  
- digital hardware  
- executes instructions from an ISA  
- e.g.:
    - x86 ISA: i5, i7, Opteron, Phenom  
    - ARM: Cortex A15, Cortex A9, Kynetis K  

## Digital Systems are comprised of Seven Layers
